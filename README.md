 # Lean Manufacturing Analyzer

This project is a Python-based analysis tool designed to identify inefficiencies
and waste in manufacturing processes using Lean Manufacturing principles.
It analyzes production data and highlights areas such as waiting time,
unnecessary motion, and defects to support better process optimization.

## 📌 Objective
To help understand and visualize manufacturing waste using data analysis,
making it easier to improve productivity and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – core programming language
- **Pandas** – data handling and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **CSV Files** – production data input
- **VS Code** – development environment
- 
## 📊 Key Features
- Reads manufacturing production data from CSV files  
- Compares actual values against standard benchmarks  
- Identifies different types of waste (Waiting, Motion, Defects, etc.)  
- Generates visual graphs and analytical insights  

## 📈 Output
- Waste analysis results  
- Visual charts for easier interpretation  
- Insights to support lean process improvements
  
## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of Lean Manufacturing concepts  
- Hands-on experience with data analysis in Python  
- Improved problem-solving and analytical skills
